# Exercises for Coursera Machine Learning

This is an **unofficial** companion repository for the machine learning course at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) by Andrew Ng from Stanford University.

It provides **C++** implementations of the exercises.  
In the course you only use [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).  
It is the preferred way to start programming for machine learning. Makes it a lot simpler to concentrate on math and algorithms.

So start with the **Octave** version and if you have some spare time, you can have a look at the **C++** implementations.

Because of the usage of [Ardamillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) and [PLplot](http://plplot.sourceforge.net), the pure algorithm implementation isn't that much different.

## Documentation

It is not possible to display math in Github markdown,  
so you can find the documentation at a different place: [https://kb.n4v.eu/ml/coursera/](https://kb.n4v.eu/ml/coursera/)
